<h1>A DAY OF MY LIFE DURING MCO</h1>
<p> My life during MCO is quite okay. I spent a lot my time during MCO watching movies in Netflix. </p>
    <p> I love to watch romance, crime and thriller type of movie. Yesterday, I watched The Intruder and Isn't It Romantic. </p>

    <p > Both of the movies are exciting and fun!</p>
    <p> There are times when I get too focus watching movies in Netflix, until I didn't realize that it's almost 4am. </p>
    <p> Oh, silly me! </p>
    
    <p> So that's basically what I do a lot during MCO, watching NETFLIX! &#128151;</p>
    <p> For the rest of the day, I'll just do some regular stuff like eating breakfast, lunch and dinner, take a nap, have a shower, log in to my social media... &#128512 </p>

    <p> Whatever thing that we do during MCO is okay, as long as we follow the order and stay at home. This is the time where each and everyone of us need to play our role. The best thing that we can do now to stay in, for this Covid-19 chain to break. Remember to pray too! &#128151 </p>
